# resume-optimiser

## Inspiration
We understand the internship/ job search struggle. To get through the resume screening round, we would often tailor-fit our resumes to the specific jobs we are applying for. As a result, we often spend long hours editing our resumes, a manual and tedious process. 

__What if this process was automated and simplified?__

Introducing the Resume Optimiser, powered by GPT-3. Our cutting-edge tool uses advanced language models to analyse and improve your resume, ensuring that it stands out and lands you the job of your dreams. Say goodbye to hours of editing and formatting, and let our AI-driven software do the heavy lifting for you. Try it now and see the difference for yourself!

## What it does
The Resume Optimiser allows you to input your resume (in ```.docx``` format) and a job description of your choice. Simply press "Boost Resume" and let the magic happen! (Do note that your resume should at least have an Experience, Skills, or Projects section - It's good to have all!)

Toggle through the Experience, Skills, and Projects section to see the difference!

The "Boost Meter" allows you to select a score from 1 - 10, with 10 being the score that will fit your resume with the specified job description the most. As the score gets lower, your resume will fit the job description less, but will be more similar to your original resume.
